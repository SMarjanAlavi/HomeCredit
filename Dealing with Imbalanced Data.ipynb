    "Before we apply any machine learning algorithm to predict the target of the test set, we need to see if the training set is balanced or not. If the training set is imbalance, the prediction quality drops significantly. In most of the cases like in this project, the training set is imbalanced; we have more information about the applicants who have returned their loan, and we have only few examples of the applicants who did not repaid their loan. So, if we work with this imbalance set, the prediction behaves better of the applicants with TARGET = 0, and it will face problems (higher error) on determining the applicants who will not repay their loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the first task is to find how imbalance our training set is. To find the number of Targets, we can use '.sum()' attribute. Note that we cannot use the '.count()' attribute here, because it will count both zeros and ones in the TARGET column.\n",
    "The difference between the number of tatal rows in the TARGET column and the number of the TARGETS with the value of one, gives us the number of non-target samples."
